The girl at the desk was very clear that they are doing me a favor and will not so this again. Shw went on to say all hotels do this which is false. No hotel I have stayed at  has ever done it that way .  Not my fault the hotel didn't recognize my card even though I used it to book the room initially. I should have left and stayed someplace else.\nWhen checking out , they made me wait while they checked my room to ensure I was worthy of the deposit being refunded, while ither people simply walked up to the counter and were told have a great day we will bill you later or have a great day your room will be charged to your card...why didn't they have to wait while their room was checked ?? \nThere was also hair all over the bed. Neither of us have black hair yet there were long strands of black hair all over one of the beds. I have several photos. \nI don't appreciate being treated like this.

We definitely experienced some of both.  While we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival, this suite was not ready for prime time.  None of the electrical outlets were functional, there was no body wash nor shampoo in the wall-mounted dispensers in the shower, some parts of the walls were still marked with painter\u2019s tape, and the kickplate for the stove had come unglued and was sitting on the floor.  None of these with the exception of the electrical outlets were a serious problem, but it was an indication that the hotel was undergoing growing pains.  On the positive side, the suite is spacious with a separate sitting area and TV, plus a kitchenette with more-than-a-mini-frig, plus a stove and sink.  The bathroom is huge, although there is quite a bit of wasted space (perhaps unavoidable with the design) and there are USB ports and A\u002FC outlets on each side of the king bed.  The Element is probably an excellent choice for a small family or business traveler that prefers to prepare light meals during an extended stay.\n\nSERVICE\n\nOutstanding service!  We reported the problem with our room to the front desk and were promptly given Starpoints as an apologetic gesture, and were moved to an identical suite where everything worked.  Cheryl and Gabi at the front desk were personable and friendly.  The staff in the dining area was also friendly and warm, treating us like kings and making us feel welcome.\n\nLOCATION\n\nThe Element is near the airport and even in a driving rainstorm it only took about 15 minutes to travel by car.  There isn\u2019t much around the hotel, but there is a Four Points Sheraton across the street with a full restaurant on the first floor, as well as a couple of other restaurants nearby, but nothing much.  This did not concern me since we were on our way to Banff the next morning.  Parking is available right outside the front door and an underground option also exists if you prefer.  Neither carried a charge.  The hotel does provide complimentary bikes, but we did not use those with the weather we had.\n\nOverall, I would stay here again if in a similar circumstance.  The hotel isn\u2019t exactly close to downtown without a car, so it\u2019s probably not ideal for business that takes place in downtown Calgary, but it\u2019s a good value for the amenities in the room and it\u2019s so new that it will only get better.",4,positive,"June 5, 2017",2855 Sunridge Way NE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T1Y 7K7

Unfortunately the second time did not leave us wanting to stay again.  This hotel is fairly new and the design is very modern which definitely drew us to stay there.  The rooms are amazing with full kitchens, large bathrooms, and comfortable bed and linens.  The first time we stayed the hotel had just opened so there wasn't a lot of people staying however the word must have gotten out because the hotel was PACKED with people and this is where the downfall started for us.  \nThis hotel is fairly large and was designed to host more of a business crowd however it wasn't designed to accommodate the large amount of families that were staying there.  The breakfast would have been amazing however there was not food left when we went down for breakfast as the ravenous food hungry families had decimated everything in sight leaving scraps here and there.  There is a omelette station where they make eggs to order however it was lined up down the lobby and I felt sorry for the women behind the counter making the eggs as it was clear she could not keep up.  There were so many people at breakfast that they spilled out into the lobby and were eating on the couches and chairs which looked like a cheesy Vegas buffet.  Didn't reflect well on the hotel for sure as people do not care what their feed station looks like when they leave.  \nWe also had trouble finding parking when we arrived back to the hotel as there was not 1 spot left above or below ground.  We ended up parking in a no parking zone above ground and the front desk clerk indicated that we would not be towed.  Definitely chaos around this hotel when busy.  \nTo top it all off our room was not cleaned properly as there were visible signs of dirt in the corners of the room and in and around the bathroom.  Not cool.

We originally booked the Standard King room but were upgraded to the Studio Suite & were on the 8th floor.  This is our second time staying at an Element hotel (first stay was at the Burnaby location).\n\nLocation - About a 15 minute or less drive away from the airport.\n\nCheck-In & Check-Out: Both were very quick and service was friendly and top-notch.  Upon checking our room we were upgraded which was a very nice surprise.  We were travelling with a baby so the extra space was definitely appreciated.  Check-out was incredibly quick also.  \n\nLobby:  The lobby area was very open with plenty of seating.  There is an area with infused water (lemon and or apple while we were there) which was a really nice touch.  There were desks with computers and the breakfast area is also located on the main floor.  General look of the hotel is modern and chic.  \n\nRoom:  We stayed in the Studio Suite and loved it!  There was a king sized bed which was extremely comfortable, seating area with large couch, TV and desk area.  The kitchen was large and had everything that we needed - great size fridge (with freezer), microwave, toaster, stove, dishwasher, utensils, flatware, the list goes on.  One great touch to the kitchen area was the sink attachment that allowed you to have filtered water.  The bathroom was a great size with plenty of counter space and stand up shower with rain shower head.  We really loved the room and felt very comfortable.  There was plenty of room for us plus our little one and his travel crib.\n\nComplimentary Breakfast:  We really loved the breakfast!  Unfortunately, some of the section was missing that was at the Burnaby location but nonetheless we really enjoyed our breakfast.  Every day there was a selection of bread\u002Fenglish muffins\u002Fbagels, either muffins and\u002For banana bread, cereal, hard boiled eggs, egg white frittata with spinach, yogurt with options of dried fruit or granola to add as well as a selection of juices.  There was a station just off from the breakfast area with a type of food that changed every day.  While we were there they served: avocado toast with egg and veggies, egg white scramble with veggies, pancakes with Nutella and fruit and french toast with Nutella and fruit.  To me this is what makes up for less overall breakfast selection because each day the made-to-order breakfast station was new and absolutely delicious!  \n\nComplimentary Snacks: Honestly no where near as good as the Burnaby location.  The snacks were bread and cheese and each guest could have a complimentary drink from Monday-Thursday  \n\nService:  The overall service at this hotel was amazing and very much appreciated.  Starting off our stay being upgraded without even asking was very nice.  We called the front desk and asked if the hotel had a high chair that we could use in our room and they actually tracked on down at the restaurant at the Four Points for us to use and brought it to our room.  One notable thing that I will always remember was the amazing woman (I really wish I knew her name - she deserves a raise) who was at the breakfast station.  One morning we asked if the hotel had any avocado for our son because he really enjoyed it, she brought some to us in a small bowl.  The next morning without us even asking, she remembered our son and brought us out another small bowl of avocado.  This to me was above and beyond and really touched me that she remembered that our son liked avocado.  Really really thoughtful and amazing service.\n\nCleaning: Our room was always cleaned very well and was always done before we returned to our room by the end of the day.\n\nPool & Gym: Did not use.  The pool was closed for renovations at this time but if you wish to use the pool like we did, you are able to use the pool at the Four Points and can access it through the underground parking lot if you don\u2019t want to walk outside.\n\nWiFi: Was free & had no issues with it.\n\nParking: Was free and there was always plenty of spaces for us to park.\n\nOverall I am beyond thrilled with our stay at the Element in Calgary and I will 100% stay here again when we return later this year.

They had a freshly made egg dish and sausage done at the bar area, they had different breads, cakes and muffins. They offered great breakfast wraps and good yummy Nescafe coffee. All in all, one of the best hotel breakfast outside of Europe we've had in any chain hotels in a while. \n\nOk, the downside is parking... there isn't enough and there are a lot of large trucks, which is normal in the area, but they can't accommodate many of them. We saw so many parking spots down in the garage with only one truck in them, cause, go figure, in those small dual spots, once a truck is in there, no second car will fit. They also share the garage with the Four Points, even though they have their own garage?

This is a decent location to hit the main parts of Calgary on the main drags which was nice. There is free underground parking with your room as well as free WiFi. There are grocery stores and a McDonald's close. The room had a stove top, dishwasher, microwave (that did not work), and a full fridge which was nice. \n\nUnfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel in the future. The service from the workers was extremely lacking. We were told the day we checked in that you had to request your room to be cleaned 24 hours in advance, which is fine. The problem was even with making the request in the adequate time frame it wouldn't be done. In the week we were there we had our room serviced twice, And the first time only got done because we had to go down and point out them that it actually was not finished even with the request being put in properly. We had to call the front desk to ask for things like towels, toilet paper, hair dryer, sheets\u002Fpillows for the pull out bed for the kids. Hours and hours would go by before you MAYBE got these items. When calling the front desk they NEVER answered. It didn't matter if you were calling from the room and pressing zero, or using your own cell phone and calling the hotel, you call simply wouldn't be answered. When we would finally just walk down to the front desk the workers would be standing there visiting. We cleaned our own room daily basically begging for new towels each day. When we didn't see housekeeping in the hall we would ask them to take our garbage (that we had placed in garbage bags for them already so all they had to do was take the closed bag) or at least take our wet towels and we would be told no. \n\nThe pool was ok. There was never any pool towels available and like I said we were given only two towels for our room so we didn't want to use our room towels for the pool. We would have to ask the front desk for pool towels and the one day they gave us two towels to share for a family of four and they were small square floor towels, which we used. The pool has no excitement. We ended up buying a few floaty toys from the dollar store so the kids had something to do in the pool. The hot tub was closed off with chairs and caution tape. If you have kids I'm sure you can find a hotel with a more interactive fun pool for the children to use. \n\nWe checked in as a family of four and we were continuously treated as our room only had two guests. When we checked in our hotel booking clearly stated it was a family of four and the front desk even confirmed with us that we were two adults and two children so it wasn't news to anyone that ever actually had four people in it. Getting items was near impossible. When they did bring us up new items it would be one or two towels, one toilet roll, etc. Felt like they were really stingy. Our hotel was charged a few extra hundred dollars more than the bill should of been. When we inquired about this we were told that we'd be refunded. As of right now the refund has not gone through, but I will be giving that a few more days to see. I understand that they need to check the rooms but when our rooms stay is in the 600s and they have a hold of $1,000 on our card it is inconvenient to wait multiple business days to be charged properly. When we were there we actually end up having to extend our stay a couple nights and they refused to match the amount that we had booked for raising the cost of our rooms for the last two nights. We had no other option at this point but it felt unfair to charge us more for extra nights considering the above. \n\nOverall, find another hotel to stay at where you're not cleaning your own room for a week, begging for towels and toilet paper, a mediocre pool, chasing the workers to answer the phone, and then waiting multiple business days to be charged appropriately.",3,negative,"July 17, 2021",2855 Sunridge Way NE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T1Y 7K7

The Hilton central booking was a real challenge right from the start. Even though I have a Hilton membership (somewhere -haven't used it in a few years) they insisted on using my husband's number and email, event though I gave them my name and credit card. Then I had to change one of the rooms and things got even stickier: it took many minutes and repeating our needs, but eventually I believed we had sorted things out.  Thankfully I got nervous the morning  of our planned arrival and called the hotel directly. Sure enough, central booking had goofed. After another lengthy chat with the fellow at the front desk, I was assured that we would have the proper room. He had my credit card. He also asked for the names of each person checking in so he could take their cards in place of mine. All good, right? When I and my friend arrived we asked at the desk if there was any parking available and were told no, use the public lot across the street. When we returned from parking we found the three others had checked in. We went up to our room and discovered that my phone call in the morning had been for naught - they arrived  to find the room had not been changed. They also told us there was underground parking in the rear of the hotel. We ordered bedding for the sofabed and didn't get any sheets. So clearly there are some communication issues. However it all worked out. The staff were all very apologetic about the glitches and eager to help. We decided to eat dinner in the hotel dining room and had an absolutely amazing 3-star meal for a most reasonable price. I hope the chef stays! Then we were able to take the C-train (free downtown) to our evening event and back. We had a corner 'suite' room (i.e. there's a hide-a-bed and and extra chair in the larger room) with huge windows and a spectacular view in two directions. Huge comfy king bed, room for our stuff. Only thing I dislike is bathrooms that have sliding doors with frosted glass. They don't shut out any noise or light for those trying to sleep.  But we all agreed we'd do it again.

The hotel was perfectly adequate for my business travel needs however I'm not sure that it would be the best fit for a family style vacation. There are a few off-site dining options within easy foot travel however most were fast food variety,  I did try to dine at the Korean restaurant that was just across the way but it seemed very popular and there was wait to be seated.  Other option was an A&W stand kitty corner to the hotel but it wasn't appealing to me during my stay.\n\nI had a king bed sized room on the third floor (one level down from the lobby) and it was clean but a bit on the small size.  Room amenities are somewhat Spartan but again, perfectly adequate for solo business travel.  Noise from outside the hotel was not an issue and black out blinds did their job.  I had one meal at their on-site restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and presentation.  Wasn't expecting much but the meal was just fine and the service was worthy of a higher end property. Had two breakfasts and they were both perfectly fine and again, service was representative of what would be expected in a higher rated hotel.  Occupancy levels may be down (seasonally\"") as the hotel did not appear to be very full and the restaurant was not open continuously throughout the day, i.e., open for breakfast, then closed for a few hours then open for lunch and closed again before reopening for dinner.  There was at area set aside for a buffet but it was not in use during my stay.  Kudos to the manager for making an adjustment in our billing due to malfunctioning hvac unit during my stay.

The bathroom was a bit tight, but with the sink situated outside the bathroom it made it easier for 2 people to get ready in the mornings.  Our booking came with vouchers for the onsite restaurant.  They had an excellent buffet on every morning and it was available until 11 am.  The dishes on the buffet changed each day so there was always a nice variety.  The vouchers permitted having the buffet or ordering from the menu.  What I found really convenient, though, was the hotel's proximity to the C Train line.  I was prepared to walk to Stampede Park because I figured it was only about a 1\u002F2 hour by foot, but the desk staff advised us that the train was just behind the hotel and the Park was 2 stops away.  He provided lots of information for us including pricing.  It was so close to the train stop, just out the lower door and across the parking lot.  For those that enjoy walking, you could also get to the Chinook Centre which would be about a 1\u002F2 hour walk in the opposite direction.  Although there weren't a lot of dining options close to the hotel, with the train being so handy, you could easily take the train into the city centre to enjoy all that is offered there.  I didn't have time to experience the fitness room or the indoor pool, but was certainly glad they were available tot me.

Throughout the booking and  our stay there were a number of issues that came up and during each one the staff were polite and courteous however unable to resolve any of them.  \n1) My experience started when booking a hospitality suite for our team to use as a meeting spot, for meals, etc.  I called an inquired about the different types of suites, looking for the largest room possible.  The person on the phone described the suite to me that was available, I indicated that I would have to confirm with my team and would call back the next day.  When I called back I learned that the hotel had not only booked me into the suite the night before but also charged me for the suite (without my approval, using my billing information from my personal booking) for 3 nights when I would only need it for 2.  The hotel was unable to refund me for the extra night although able to cancel the booking for that night, telling me that I will be refunded for the night when I check in.  When I checked into the suite I am then informed that they can not refund me the additional night until I check out.  When I checked out I again have to ask for the unused and previously cancelled night to be refunded.  The refund eventually came approximately 3 days after I checked out (due to banking processes) and nearly 2 months after I had originally cancelled the additional nights stay that I never agreed to book in the first place.\n\n2) Through various sports activities we have used group bookings many times  in the past and our team has always been placed in the same general area of the hotel, always on the same floor and usually in the same hallway.  This time our group which consisted of 13 rooms total was spread over all 4 floors of the hotel.  There were at least 3 other groups from the same tournament who were also spread over multiple floors.  This causes increased traffic throughout the site and causes inconvenience for the groups.\n\nOur teams come to Calgary often for tournaments and will not be booking at this hotel again.  \n",3,negative,"February 7, 2020",8360 Blackfoot Trail SE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2J 7E1

Which shouldn\u2019t have been an issue. \nHowever our transmission went once we hit Jasper (4hours still to go) and we were forced to turn back rather then attempt the Parkway where there is no cell or services. \nI called the hotel advising we had to cancel, this is when I found out I couldn\u2019t however was advised that the manager could determine that and they thought would. But was asked to call back in 30 min. I did and was advised still no manager. Given we were limping the truck back to Prince George we lost service. I did not get service again for a few hours (very slow drive in low gear only). Third call I was not given the manager but simply told they stood by the cancellation policy. \nI raised my concern with head office and they said it will still be determined by the specific hotel and manager.

When we went back to WestJet they told us that all they could suggest was finding a comfortable chair in the airport and making ourselves comfortable until our flight at 4:00 pm the next day.  We started walking towards the Marriott hoping that they might have a room.  On the way we passed visitor information at the Calgary airport and I decided to see if they had any suggestions.  The man behind the desk gave Holiday Inn a call and arranged a room for us at a very attractive rate.  He told us where to go for the shuttle and Holiday Inn transferred us to the hotel.  Their driver told us to just go inside and he would take care of the baggage.  The front desk was great and gave us a lovely room with 2 double beds at a very good rate.  The room is spacious, there are nice toiletries in the washroom, comfortable beds, good TV and a very comfortable chair to lounge on.  The only thing that might be an issue for some is the lack of a proper desk for the computer.  \nIt was late at night when we arrived and we had been told by the front desk that the restaurant had just closed but we could order in pizza from a local restaurant for delivery if we wanted.  When we went to our room we saw a couple with take -out containers and asked where they got the food, they said they got it from the restaurant just before closing.  I went downstairs and they were washing the floors but I asked if it was possible to get anything at all.  The gentleman was so gracious \u2013 I guess he could tell how stressed I was.

I used to book this property from 2019 frequently. It was a great property in the beginning. In one of my stays, my brother had an accident slipped in the bathtub (In February 2020). There are no slip-free mats or protection in their bathrooms, and they are very unsafe. I pointed out this issue to the then General Manager. She assured preventive action for future stays, installing mats. My brother had to travel the same day, and we couldn't complain to the related authorities. I'm not sure how they got approved for these types of bathrooms.\nStill, I liked the property and decided to book again a week before. I expected the same customer service and comfort. Unfortunately, everything changed in this property. The very first impression even wasn't that good. I could not see those friendly front desk staff who used to give a warm welcome. Firstly I'm very disappointed about the room they provided me. I requested a room away from the elevators. But they allotted the same room (523) where my brother had the accident in 2019. And they lied to me that they have that kind of room only near the elevator. As per the floor plan, there are many rooms away from the elevator with similar arrangements. We couldn't sleep because of the noise from people using elevators. The bedsheet had some bloodstains. There were no coffee cups. No enough towels. Two different types of shampoos, one used by someone and a conditioner. They used to serve an excellent breakfast for $ 18.00, which is no more there. In the bathroom, there is an adjustable shower head which is almost 8ft above ground level.\nI'm 6ft to reach it, but someone not that tall needs a step ladder to reach it. If you want to experience some mist shower effect, then go to their bathroom. You can feel the slowest ever shore speed in your life. One thing I learned from reviewing these hotels. People will see the good reviews, book them, which in turn will increase the demand. Once they are in high demand, then these hotels will be thankless, never recognize you. They will discriminate against people with non-English last names and move to the dirtiest ever rooms available with their property. Never write anything good about them. Anyways, this property seems fully booked nowadays with many tourists from outside the province. And they don't care about people like me who contributed five-star reviews in the past.

They also offer airport shuttle that you can book for a specific timeslot, and that is always a plus. \nWe also thought that having a restaurant onsite was very handy for breakfasts and dinners. Pacini restaurant was however a bit of a let down for us. It is a very nice restaurant with big menu (veggie options available) and very pleasant service, but food can be so-so, it is quite expensive and it\u2019s not staffed properly at times. When getting breakfast before check out one day they actually only had 1 server which meant that a bunch of hotel guests had to wait to be seated, and some actually decided to skip breakfast because the restaurant simply couldn\u2019t keep up and folks needed to catch a flight. \nWe also technically were supposed to have breakfast included in our rate, we got a voucher for $15 per person; however what we didn\u2019t realize was that you can only have 2 or 3 breakfast options from the menu, and if you select something else, the voucher didn\u2019t apply. I admit this was probably something we missed on the voucher, but I was taken aback when, after picking something else from the menu (literally different type of eggs that I wanted), I was told my meal was not covered, not even a portion of it (i.e. up to the value of the voucher). So I booked a hotel for the first time ever with \u201Cbreakfast included\u201D (not realizing it\u2019s based on vouchers), and after a meal I\u2019m told my voucher is no good for what I picked, and they won\u2019t deduct the value of the voucher from my bill, not even a price of coffee (!) that was included in the voucher. We ended up paying $60 for breakfast that was \u201Cincluded in the room rate\u201D. Very disappointing.\nOn our way home, we picked breakfast out of the voucher menu, and it was good, no complaints. \nSo all in all, a great hotel, but I\u2019m not impressed with their restaurant and especially with the \u2018free breakfast\u2019 policy\u002Fpractice, and as a result I likely won\u2019t be returning to this property (only because I have another good option for Calgary airport that works better for me).

Unfortunately, our stay this time left us quite disappointed.\n\nFirst off, the good:\n1) The hotel is very new, so everything was nice and clean, with a modern aesthetic.\n2) The amenities were good...nice fitness room with a variety of ellipticals, treadmills, kettle bells etc. Pool was nice, bright and clean. There is a lobby bar and restaurant as well but we did not try it.\n3) Ample free parking, but it\u2019s a little bit of a walk to the lobby.

We were told it would only be 15 minutes max, but he would come get us from the lobby as soon as it was done. 30 minutes later, my wife asks if the room was ready yet and the clerk tells us the maintenance man underestimated the time. But miraculously the room was ready immediately when she asked. No apologies.\n2) Upon check in, we asked if they had a crib\u002Fpack and play that we could use. The person at front desk said that he would check with housekeeping and let us know. There was no follow up and no crib waiting for us when we got into the room.\n3) the following day we left at 9 in the morning and got back at 8. Found that both of our room keys were not working. Went to front desk to let them know (which we had to wait for 20 min because there was only one person working) and instead of apologizing for the inconvenience he said we must have placed our keys beside our phone. I told him we didn\u2019t but he just kind of brushed it off. \n4) Finally got to our room and discovered that housekeeping \u201Cforgot\u201D to clean our room. So no towels, messy room...just further salt in the wound. Called down to front desk to deliver 3 sets of towels, and housekeeping did show up within 20 mins, but unfortunately they only provided us with 3 bath towels.

I was able to move my flight to an earlier time but was inside the cancellation time for the hotel, so I stayed the night.\nThe hotel presents well from the exterior, smells of freshness and clean when you walk in, and the lobby kept clean with newer furnishing.  I checked in and went directly to the restaurant to get food before they closed.  The prices were decent for an airport hotel with limited offerings near the location.  I ordered the Mahi and it was cooked properly, tasted wonderful and the sides were just as good.  The cheesecake was good but reminded me of the multi-wheel cheesecake you get at Costco.  It was good but paled in comparison to the Mahi.  The waiter was a younger guy that was engaging, had stories about working for Marriott, his travels and places he still wants to see.  Overall, a great end of the day dining experience.\nOnce I got to the room, it was very nice.  With my status and an upgrade coupon, I was able to get an upgrade to a suite that had a nice, large shower and tub in the suite.  There was limited noise from outside to interfere with sleep.  The bed is the typical Marriott set up providing a good nights sleep.  The TV was a nice size and the controls for lights and heat easy to access and use.\nThe following morning, I was up for breakfast.  The good experience from the previous night, at the same restaurant, was smashed for breakfast.  I arrived to a 'wait to be seated' sign so I waited for 5-7 minutes watching the waitstaff serve and clean tables.  There were 3 active tables, 7-10 tables to be cleaned and three waitstaff in the area.  Once I was able to get one person\u2019s attention, he wanted me to sit at a table that had not been clean from the previous customer.  I found a clean table with no silverware with expectations that the waiter would see I need silverware and bring some to the table.  Once I was seated, the waiting continued.  Even if they were busy, which they were not, a flyby to say \""I will be there shortly' is expected.  After waiting more than 10 minutes, with all of the waitstaff walking in and around me, I held up the menu to get their attention.  One said, 'I thought you were taking that table' to the other person\u2019s reply 'no, it's yours'.  I ordered but the staff did not write down the order.  Before he left, he asked me again what I wanted so I repeated it and said 'it is ok to write it down' but he said he was good.  I handed over my free breakfast coupon before he left.  When he brought the coffee, he confirmed the order and had it wrong.  Third repeat of the correct order to the waiter and the food still came to me wrong and I had to retrieve my own silverware so I could eat.  I had already waited 20+ minutes on getting food so I ate what they brought to me.  What was prepared was good but not what I ordered.  I rationalized with myself that breakfast was free, so it was not that big of an issue.  After the food was served the restaurant became a ghost town.  No refill on coffee, no water, no one to help.  \nI retrieved my own refill of coffee and when I got back to the table the check was waiting with a dollar value listed for the free breakfast, so I corrected the bill, left a generous tip for the service, and took my coffee to go.  At the time and as I write this review, I was amazed at the differences in service at the same location.  \nThe other item that need to be addressed is the parking lot and exit ways.  When I arrived, there was snow coming down, but the lot had not been cleaned in a while so most of the parking spots were several inches deep in snow and ice.  As I got out of the car to grab my bag, I did a slip and slide using the car next to me to break my fall.  When I got up the following morning, It had snowed overnight.  I left about 12N with not even the main driving lanes addressed for snow and ice.  I took care of some business and came back through in that afternoon to see nothing had been done to address the parking lot or driveways.  \nFast forward 14 days when I came to stay again to find three piles of snow in the lot with the majority of the parking spots, all driving lanes, and the front drop off area covered with snow after 4+ days of no snow in the area.  This is one item management needs to address to reduce the risk of injury to customers.\nWhen I used the stairs to leave the hotel for dinner, I got to an exit way that was blocked by snow and ice.  I put my shoulder to it so I could get out and I expect in an emergency adrenaline would help get the door open but all exit ways should be cleared.\nOverall, the stay was very good, but the morning restaurant crew needs training and coaching in their roles and how to provide good customer service.  The snow needs addressed.\n",4,positive,"March 17, 2023",671 Aero Drive NE Aero Drive NE & Aero Crescent NE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2E 8Z9

While out for a walk the following morning, we discovered the Westin a short distance away.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with warm, friendly smiles from the staff in a well appointed and inviting lobby.  We decided to eat lunch here instead of our hotel and were very glad we did!  The food was absolutely fabulous and our server Gwen provided excellent and engaging service.  The Food and Beverage Manager came over to greet us and welcomed us to the restaurant.  The General Manager Siddhesh Dharankar also introduced himself and we had a fantastic discussion  with him after we finished our lunch.  \nDespite the flight issues, our experience at the Westin was excellent and certainly made our short stay in Calgary very enjoyable.

The check in desk was efficient and friendly and there is plenty of parking. The room was clean and well equipped with a robe, slippers, and an air conditioner\u002Fheater that worked well and wasn't loud or annoying. The bed was very soft and comfortable, but the pillows were all the feather style that flatten as soon as your head touches them. I can appreciate some people like that but maybe having a few different options of firmer larger pillows would be a good idea. \nI ate at the restaurant twice and both times service was great and the food was outstanding. The bartender was also very friendly and they have a good assortment of beer on tap and other cocktails. \nThe only thing that would stop me from coming back is a very pervasive perfume smell that hits you in the face as soon as you walk in the lobby. It was there for the 3 days I stayed and never dissipated. It's tolerable if you are just walking though, but it is also just as strong over in the restaurant, which really affected the enjoyment of my meal.

Was looking for a comfortable king bed and the only room left was the jacuzzi suite. I researched the hotel before leaving on my trip and they advertised premium comfort beds. I decided to book the jacuzzi suite ($212.00) as other hotels in the area were sold out of rooms. We arrived for check in late around 10pm got to our room and unpacked\u002Fsettled in. At first sight was ok with the room it was big and had lots of room as advertised. Exhausted from our trip into Calgary we got ready for bed went to was up and found no hot water in the bathroom sink. Being exhausted already decided to deal with it and just go to bed without letting the front desk know about the hot water issue until morning. Laid down in bed around 11:20 and found the beds to be extremely uncomfortable...no way we could sleep there. I paid extra for the top King suite and it was not worth it. Already very exhausted we re-packed and searched around for another hotel and booked in at Blackfoot Inn King executive suite for $216. By the time I got to the front desk to politely explain we were not satisfied and would like a refund it was 11:40pm. The front desk offered to switch rooms to another one and when I asked if they offered a more comfortable bed she stayed all the beds were the same. She also stated a refund would not be issued. I asked if I could speak to a manager, of course no manager was available until morning. I then left and checked into Blackfoot Inn, very frustrated and exhausted we finally settled in to the Executive suite, the room was significant better then anything Service Plus inn had to offer. Very clean, the bathroom had hot water and the beds were the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever slept in for a comparable price. The next day I called to speak with a manager he stated no refund would be issued, due to the fact we used there services longer then allowed in there refund \u201Cgrace period\u201D. I asked where it was stated in any of there policies how much time is allotted for said \u201Cgrace period\u201D. His statement was it\u2019s in there. I then explained I still wasn\u2019t happy and will be leaving a review of my experience. He then got agitated( I honestly was polite and calm) and he told me to not threaten him with bad reviews and he would give me one free nights stay instead of a refund. I thanked him for the offer and kindly told him I was not threatening anyone but a one night stay would not help me as I\u2019m only in Calgary for the one night we already stayed and don\u2019t travel to Calgary often. A extra nights stay would be not used. He then was very rude and angry and told me that\u2019s all he could do. So here I am writing my first ever review of a hotel and explaining my terrible experience. All I wanted was a decent nights sleep to prepare myself for an important meeting the next morning.

We had 2 fur babies and we began to worry, as I work for AHS and wasn\u2019t home a lot.  So we made the decision to pack our cats up ( and my 22 yr old daughter ) and find a hotel with some a\u002Fc.  We had originally booked and prepaid for another \u201Cbig chain \u201C and the day we were set to check in they suddenly decided they wanted a $500 pet fee per room.  First off it\u2019s a low end chain not a Hyatt or Marriott or fairmont, I told them I was paying nearly $700 for 2 nights and were they insane.  I explained I was desperate and pleaded for some compassion since we were so hot and the manager would not even bother then cancelled my booking ( but not before they charged me one night stay  which still has not been refunded ). \n   I called the Sandman Signature Calgary Airport and the front desk lady Gagan ( hope I spelt that right ) was so kind from the moment I called.  She was so sympathizing with what we had gone through.  She went and spoke to her GM Tracy ( truly a god send) and they not only gave us a special rate, but they only charged incidentals for 1 room ( we had 2 rooms) and they waved the pet fees for both cats.  I was floored and cried because I was honestly terrified my cats would overheat.  I explained the other hotel I had booked cancelled and then charged me a one night stay only to say they would be refunding it. Still had not happened.  They accommodated us by even giving us a joining room so we could go between each other\u2019s room so I could go to work and my daughter could watch both cats.  It was the perfect setup and the cats kept cool.  I want to say the rooms were beautiful and quiet and our boys loved their stay.

None of those is offered.   In addition, while they advertise as pet friendly and we paid $30 extra, there was no form of acknowledgement in the reservation confirmation of the pet, so I had to call to confirm, and there was no \""pet essentials\"" that they advertise on the website (e.g., we expected something like a bed, dog bowl, treat that we have gotten from other hotel chains).

Only on the hour every hour and they only wait a few minutes then go back to the hotel which is 5 minutes away. We had just missed it (drove away while we were running for it) and they refused to call the driver to return. Only after some serious arguing did they have the driver return to pick us up. The driver was great (no complaints - very friendly) and said all they needed to do was call and they would have come back. We had to reserve our seats for the shuttle in the morning. Luckily there was space available to get out of there, unlike some other reviews.\nRestaurant\u002Fbar - every table was dirty. Only one table with customers besides us. They closed at 10:30. We arrived at 9:55 and were told the kitchen was closing right away so we ordered just fries and onion rings. My husband is pretty sure the onion rings were made of rawhide they were so overcooked. Simple order of fries - burnt. \nSo we decided it was time to call it a day and head to bed after a long day of travelling. Thought it would be a quick shower but couldn't get hot water. Enough time lapsed that we called the front and were told to run the shower for at least 10 minutes. You're kidding right? Nope. After running the shower for 10-15 minutes  - hot water.

The shuttle only runs hourly and often gets fully booked by the time I arrive. \n\nAnd when I land back in Calgary, the shuttle used to be on demand which was very convenient, but now it only picks up hourly too, which left me waiting 50 minutes for a shuttle that was sitting idle five minutes away. Furthermore, I spent 20 minutes trying to contact the hotel from my phone, and the staff on the other line kept hanging up and declining the call. I understand that staff are busy, but in 20 minutes staff could have simply taken 20 seconds to tell me the shuttle would be arriving at a specified time instead of dropping the call. Eventually I had to call the priority member Hyatt line who was able to talk to someone and get me the simple information I needed. \n\nAs an airport hotel, the shuttle is largely why many guests stay here.

We also booked a second night on line, as it was cheaper.  We notified the front desk about both.  We asked if we needed to check in again for the second night and they said no, not needed.  We left for supper and expected them to fix the air conditioning.\nWe returned at 10:30 p.m.  Nothing was fixed.   We were offered another room but our stuff was already spread out and unpacked and I needed to get up early.  So I asked if they could at least give us a fan.  They agreed.   A maintenance man appeared shortly thereafter with a fan to drop off.  I plugged it into 4 different outlets and concluded that they gave me an inoperable fan.  I called again.  The same maintenance man returned.  I asked him to demonstrate how to use this fan.  He then proceeded to try and walk into our washroom without knocking.  My wife was in there using it, so I immediately stopped him and suggested he try outlets in the other rooms.  He tried 3 outlets, discovered that it did not work, muttered a single profanity and left.  He did not return with a working fan.  We waited and waited and then called the front desk again to see when he was planning to return, as I needed to get to sleep.  We were told he had no plan to return as they had no other working fans in a building with 23 floors of hotel rooms.  I asked when they were planning to advise us of this new development?  They said the maintenance man should have.  He didn't.

Her response was to take down my email address and maybe contact me some day.

data\ca\154913\155241\873368784.html,Sandman Signature Calgary Downtown Hotel,"""Location, location, location, that old real estate term can also be applied to hotels. While searching for a place for a couple of nights in Calgary I had several criteria. One of course was price, something within the budget I had established.  Secondly an indoor pool would be nice. I was visiting my niece and her family and there was a chance the kids may want to use it, they didn\u2019t as it turned out.\n\nFinally, location. I decided against staying next to the Airport, or out in the suburbs where my niece resided and set on a central location. I presumed downtown Calgary would be fine as it would offer the best options for dining and nightlife for the times I wasn\u2019t seeing family. \n\nWell, it that regard to location I was a bit off. The Sandman Signature Calgary is located at the corner of 7th Ave SW and 8th St SW across from the Century Gardens. The closet grouping of restaurants bars and  pubs were several blocks to the south in the Beltline area  between 12th and 17th  Ave. Not much of a walk really unless it\u2019s really cold, which during my four night stay it was. \n\nThe location was good for two reasons though as it turned out. First the Calgary LRT or tram ran right outside the hotel along 7th Ave, which made it very convenient for visiting the outlying areas of the city which I had to do on a couple of occasions.  \n\nSecondly the hotel is directly connected to the Plus 15 system of elevated walkways that connect most of the office towers in the downtown core of the city. This meant that I could run errands, grab a coffee, and generally explore the downtown area in reasonable comfort despite the chilling temperatures.\n\ncheck-in was easy, and I\u2019d already prepaid for my room including using a free night from the third-party booking service. Check out was also smooth and fast and the $200.00 damage deposit was removed from my credit card in a couple of days.\n\nI was advised that the Covid policy of no daily maid service was still in effect, however if I needed towels linens etc to contact the front desk. The only time I did need to contact them was to deal with two minor issues, one a small leak in the toilet and second an issue with the safe not opening or closing properly. In both instances someone came up almost immediately and was able to resolve both issues quickly.\n\nThe room was larger than I expected, including a long entry hallway. The Queen-sized bed had plenty of thick comforters and blankets and there was also a comfortable easy chair. A built in wall unit contained enough drawers for my needs as well as a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge. A large flat screen smart TV with several local and basic cable channels was mounted on the wall above that.\n\nThere was more than enough closet space and hangers for my needs, often an issue I find in hotel rooms. There was as I noted a safe with electronic combo large enough for my 16\u201D laptop, and other valuables and a nice surprise in a thick terry cloth robe which came in handy.\n\nThe bathroom was a bit small compared to the rest of the room  but well laid out with a nice rain fall shower head and plenty of towels and toiletries. There were no issues with either water pressure or hot water during my stay. \n\nI was on the eighth floor and facing south west which gave a good view, sadly of not much aside from nearby apartment and office buildings and the aforementioned LRT line and part of Century Gardens.\n\nAs for amenities there were plenty. As I said there was an indoor pool and a hot tub which I did use daily. The towel came in handy for the trips here from my room.  A good supply of fresh towels was on hand so you didn\u2019t have to borrow any from your room.  Off this was a fully equipped exercise room.  There was also a small coin operated laundry room, which as I was at the end of a lengthy trip I did make use of. The front desk provides change for the machines and usually has soap for sale. They were out of this during my stay but a quick trip to a nearby store solved this. All these are on the third floor\n\nThere is one chain bar\u002Frestaurant, Moxies, with an entrance of the lobby. I did see another bar on the same floor as the pool but it was closed hopefully just for renovations. As I noted other evening options are a bit of a walk. \n\nThere is a business suite with a fully equipped kitchen on the fourth floor, access provided via the front desk. It was mentioned to me on check in but I forgot about it until my last morning. There are toasters, coffee makers assorted muffins, fruit bars and breakfast baked goods and a fridge full of bottled water and juices. There is a nice seating area here overlooking the poll with another large flat screen. \n\nOverall despite not being as close to local restaurants as I wanted I have no complaints. The room was clean and comfortable and the service well above par. I doubt I\u2019ll be back in Calgary in the winter anytime soon, but would have no issues staying here in warmer months on my next trip. \n",3,negative,"December 30, 2022",888 7 Ave SW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2P 3J3

And I have to say that the reviews are correct.  We arrived in the middle of a hellacious thunderstorm but were able to get help in immediately with our many bags.  We were given an umbrella to stay dry.  Our bellboy, Jiri, was a sweetheart.  The hotel is interesting--they use playful colors and have distinctive, idiosyncratic furniture--do sit in one of the two overstuffed armchairs in the lobby!--but yet are very dignified.  I had a lot of questions before booking and Gor Pragnesh, the guest services manager, was very patient and understanding as he answered them all.  I felt at home and very coddled by all the staff.  And there were lots of little details that made our stay comfortable.  Good linens and amenities, nice sheets, a fast elevator, a quiet air conditioner, quiet hallways and an interesting room layout.  There were design decisions that I would not have made, but I appreciated.  And read that sentence again.  There were actually design decisions that went beyond functionality and into thoughtful and (mostly) tasteful decorations.  It was well beyond a standard room.  If you stay there, check out their folding iron--I've never seen that before.

When you have a baby and a toddler, its sometimes easier this way.  A tray would have been awesome. \n3) No bell-hop.  I don't know if thats a covid thing, or a staffing shortage, but when you have 2 kids, it really helps to have someone assist with getting your stuff up.\n\nAll in all, I think this could have been a 5, but I also know the industry's been hit, and I'm assuming there's been some staffing shortages, and maybe even supply shortages.  Ultimately, the hotel overall was still very clean and well airconditioned. \n The views up at the 31st floor was also quite nice.

The second night I was hoping that the train noise was a one-time thing - but I was too naive - here it came again, 12:15am sharp.\n\nThis is still a very decent hotel, very spacious room with full kitchen, great for family.

The rooms are always spotlessly clean! Never seen it done better - even in a 5 star. The continental breakfast is great, though basic. It is a great location as near to COP, University of Calgary and close to all major highways. I just hope they don't get too busy so I can't get a room.

I'm from BC and had just spent a week in Saskatchewan with family, at a wedding, having a wonderful trip.  I had taken my parents back to Sask with me, a nice trip of making some beautiful memories. The updates to the bathroom area were decent. I'm a clean freak, and the room cleanliness was quite satisfactory.  The bed was comfy.  The shower was nice. The room door lock however, which had been removed (not sure why they don't have keycard entry anymore) was duct taped and the door wouldn't stay closed unless the deadbolt latch was used, which required an actual key, and was kind of a pain to use.  Not a huge concern, but worth a mention.  My biggest issue was the vanity plugin.  It did not work, which I found out when I went to dry my hair.  I had driven for 10 hours, and was starving. I just wanted to get ready and go out and eat. I had no power at the mirror, I'm not sure about anyone else, but I need to see what I'm doing when it comes to drying my hair.  I've stayed in many hotels and motels, and there's always a working plugin at the vanity! Plus the coffee, and coffee maker were right there.  Yes, of course I could have moved the coffee maker to a plugin that worked.  My point is, when I brought it to the desks attention, he was very rude, and he said something very disturbing to me, which I will not put here due to the nature of it!!!  Yes, of course I was angry, even more so once I had discovered that they were already aware of it prior to my check in, and they did not notify me about it.  At $180 a night, really, for that!!  He just kept saying he'd give me my money back and we could leave.  What he should have said to me, was I'm sorry for your inconvenience, lets see what we can do.  No, he just kept saying \""you need to calm down. I was calm, just very matter of fact, and I told him I was upset, especially with his attitude, and especially after what he said to me.  All it would have taken was an apology, and the offer to help rectify the situation.  It's unfortunate that his people skills are not up to par for working with the public!  He just kept saying he'd give me money back and we could leave, amongst other interesting statements. I asked him to at least find me an extension cord.  They were able to come up with that.  But still no apology for not telling me about the issue.

I am very disappointed with the front desk at the 4 points, especially since they can see my profile ( spending over 75 nights a year at the Marriott)  Lesson learned and I should have stayed at the Delta downtown. I was hoping to get a little better service from them. I guess that is why the Delta being a little more expensive can offer great customer service to their platinum members and the four points cannot.",3,negative,"August 16, 2019",2875 Sunridge Way NE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T1Y 7K7

We wanted a location close to the Zoo and it was very convenient to that as well as quick access for us once we entered Calgary from Saskatchewan. We arrived in Alberta shortly after they removed covid masking rules although our province of Saskatchewan still had them in place until the 13th of July. It sure seemed odd going into places with no mask. When we arrived in Calgary we though that the city still had the masking in place but were told that the City had removed the bylaw on the 6th of July. Staff at the Hotel were still wearing masks as they have to follow rules from Head Office and until they get word from the higher ups they will continue to mask. Signs were still up all over hotel stating masks mandatory but again until they get word they can not remove them. Guests however were not required to wear them although many did likely due to the confusion with the signage.\n\nHousekeeping service was still not available during our stay but anything we needed was available at front desk. Parkade under the hotel was nice for parking of vehicles. We had a king room which was nice with new renovation although I think I prefer the old style bulky Hotel furniture rather than the new trendy tables and furnishings.\n\nStaff were all helpful and friendly in passing. The normal buffet breakfast was not in operation so there was a boxed lunch available for pickup from the lounge each morning to eat back in your room. Juice, coffee, fruit, yogurt, muffins and a box with hot eggs, sausage\u002Fbacon, hash brown potatoes. Just had to let front desk know how many people and what time you would like it for pickup to ensure they had enough fresh ones ready. \n\nThe lounge was open from 4pm until 10pm or 11pm each day. Full menu is available also for dining. The star of the show was the lone staff member running the lounge who was the greeter, waiter, bartender, server and lastly a great guy to have a conversation with. His name was Don and he ran this lounge single handedly and was doing a heck of a job on all our visits. Staffing is an issue post reopening after Covid restrictions all over Alberta as staff are reluctant to come back to work and would sooner collect CERB while at home. Don loves his job and is definitely a people person. The work terminal for the purchases both food and drink went down daily and with the pace of the quests it was difficult to get it running and serve guests at the same time. Don was unable to print our bill so he just took our room number and said he would call once it was working again. When I returned to pay the bill he greeted me by name and thanked me for coming back down, I was surprised to here the greeting by name. The next day we visited the lounge again and again he greeted us by first and last name and again welcomed us back. This shocked me that he remembered our names but he said he makes a point to remember names and faces and to greet guests in that way. Don needs a raise for the way he ran this place on his own and while keeping a smile on his face.

In fact their impression did not even look like they were staffs. They would tell you the bare minimum at check in. At check out a robot could of done a better job. \n\n2nd day at 9am we asked for more towels, as they only provided towels for 2, even though we had 4 guests. Without asking for our room number was told housekeeping would make their rounds. \nHowever we received an email prior to check in there\u2019s no daily housekeeping. If we require towels to request by 10am the day of. Which we did, but was told we are incorrect. So who\u2019s telling the truth? Or again is front desk staff being lazy? Also don\u2019t bother with the Marriott app, the staffs at this place does not check the messages. \n\nThey do have a fitness centre, pool, whirlpool on site. We did see several dead bugs in the pool, so pretend it\u2019s an \u201Coutdoor\u201D pool. \nOnly had 1 pool towel left for the 4 of us, again called front desk, apparently the \u201Cnice\u201D gentleman says its not their responsibility to stock pool towels. What is this hotel and their towels?\n\nAnother nice amenities is they do have,  coin operated washer\u002Fdryer located in the parkade level. I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to use it. Imagine asking the front desk for change? They will probably blame their guests for not carrying change in a society where\u2019s it\u2019s mostly cashless.\n\nThe room is clean. They did place a bottle of water in the room which is a nice touch by the hotel. House Keeping staffs were very friendly. Good job housekeeping crew!\n\nHowever I can\u2019t tell if the room we were in are renovated or not. Some of the furniture looks updated but some weren\u2019t, the mattress was uncomfortable. The bathroom is clean, sink is updated, however the Bath tub and towel looks old. The black out blinds are good. Bottomline housekeeping did a wonderful job, however designer did a horrible job. \n\nOne elevator was not working during our entire stay, so only one elevator to serve the entire hotel. Again NEVER mentioned at time of check in. If we didn\u2019t have toddlers and stayed on the 6th floor, would of been faster to take the stairs. \n\nBreakfast was included in our rate, for guests who\u2019s rate does not include breakfast, It does cost $15.99 per person Buffet style. I wouldn\u2019t recommend paying for it, as the spread was horrible. Also day of check out, we saw dead bugs on the fruit tray. Upon brining it to their attention they brushed it off at first, eventually replace it with a new plate.but bad for guests who\u2019s looking for that extra protein. \n\nParking is free which is super nice, you can park above or underground which is nice for hot or super cold days. However the parkade is like a junk storage yard when you enter. But at least parking is free! \n\nThere are other flaws that I did not list. \nBut as my title mentioned we did get a smoking deal. But I will not stay at this hotel again even if it\u2019s free.\n\nSeems like this hotel has an identity crisis, not sure what their target market is. \nFor us we will not return to this hotel even if it\u2019s free, nor recommend it, unless your looking for a motel experience.\n\nFound out during our stay, the same management manages the Element Calgary airport next door.

I checked out 25\u002F09 and to my greatest surprise I was told I had already been refunded, which I knew was false and this fake method would cause me much distress as I live in England.

I actually did pay the bill, including gratuities, on the original bill when it was manually entered into their payment system using a prepaid Mastercard. I have requested a call back from a manager 3 separate times and have not received any response yet.

Finishes look nice, but I can see that this location will not fair well cosmetically over time.

We told her our room number, to which she responded that our breakfast was not free. I guess we are lower class!

I'm not sure what people do the other 300 plus days of the year though :\u002F anyway the hostel is cool, it's a small friendly operation and everyone seems to pitch in to make it a good place to be, the owner even did the laundry for everyone, the location is genuinely right opposite the stampede ground main gate, and walking distance to downtown, clubs pubs bars and the riverside parks. The rooms are very modern. As is the communal area and the kitchen, some other reviews have commented on noise keeping them awake, personally I slept fine but I can see how this might be a problem, most the rooms face right out to the parking lot intact my bed was less than a metre from the tailpipe of a truck haha, and also many of the rooms lead directly off the communal areas so I guess it's a fair observation by the other reviewers, although as I said I slept fine all 3 nights. I really liked the bathrooms here, there is one big shower room for each sex with a row of stalls to shower in they're really well designed with individual doors and space to get dried and dressed in privacy, it's a relatively small hostel so I never had any problem getting a shower stall whenever I needed one. I couldn't fault the cleanliness or comfort of the rooms, again it shows that the hostel is quite new, the beds don't squeak of rattle like I've experienced in some hostels. Ok so downsides, there are no lockers to store valuable personal belongings, the hostel itself is very secure with a door code after midnight and a key needed 24 hours a day, plus your room key, and I felt my belongings were safe with the other boarders in my room but not everyone feels that way so it would be nice to have lockers in the rooms even if not 1 for everyone would be nice to have the option there. The only other issue I noticed while I was here seemed to be with overbooking of rooms, fair enough this happens everywhere now and again and it was a very busy time (stampede week and the other calgary hostel is still shut from the floods) but it caused a massive argument on my final night because there were 7 people and 6 beds! This wasn't my room luckily but becuase it is a small close knit hostel everyone became involved and it was still creating issues the next morning around moving people to different rooms that were co ed or not co ed and stuff it was very confusing for everyone involved!

He was easy-going and willing to help out. \n\nThen, he gave us the tour and it went downhill from here. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the hostel has GREAT potential (cool set up, centrally located, etc.), but it's just not quite up to par when it comes to cleanliness and hygiene (ie: blocked toilet that stayed as such all through our stay, showers with weird stuff on the floor, messy kitchen - although I did see the staff member clean it up a bit before going home -, etc.) I've definitely seen worse, but I've also seen MUCH better. \n\nWhat made the stay terrible, however, was the fact that our room was on the first floor - right next to the common areas (kitchen & lounge). There was a movie night on Sunday night so there was noise up until 10-11pm (which is perfectly fine & NORMAL in hostels), but the problem presented itself when I (and 2-3 of my roommates) got woken up several times between 1am and 5am because of drunk and very, very loud people in said common areas. \n\nI usually have a high tolerance for noise and try and show comprehensiveness up until 2-3am, but I had to get up and ask them to turn it down a notch or 2 at some point. Of course, when you're drunk, you don't necessarily realize you're being loud so you go right back to it. \n\nThing is, the hostel DOES have a quiet time policy after 11pm (I believe), but since the front desk staff is here until midnight and there's no on-site Night Caretaker, therefore there's no one to ensure that that policy is respected after hours. \n\nTo be fair, most of the rooms are on the top floor and I believe that if you're on that floor, you're probably fine. And I cannot stress enough how much I appreciated the staff member's courteous customer service. I'll be mentioning these negative points at check-out and updating this with comments on how the complaint was handled. \n\nIt's sad because I feel like with a firmer hand in housekeeping matters and a NC, this place would be absolutely wonderful. \n\nRecommended for: People who like to have a good time and party and who aren't phased out by a little messiness\nTips: Request a bed on the upper floor",2,negative,"October 7, 2013",811 7 St SW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2P 1Z5

Of course, we had been chatting and enjoying beers respectfully since 5pm. I met some great people.\n\nHere are the pros and cons\nPros:\nLocation, fair price with campgrounds and the few other Canadian hostels, the operators do a good job of cleaning the common spaces and signage encouraging other to do so as well. \nEveryone I met was super nice. It is very centrally located. There was parking available if you are crazy and have a hankering to drive across Canada. I think the area was relatively safe.. I as a solo female traveler was only there for one night and had no issues.\n\nCons:\nThe biggest thing that management COULD do to alleviate issues is figure out SOME way to store belongings. I was in a small room with three sets of bunks. There were no lockers (always if if in hostels) but no where else to put luggage and belonging other than directly in the walk way. There was a tiny bit of space below bunks but not enough for a travel case much less a traveler's standard pack.  Due to the belonging being in the way as a necessity it does seem a bit messy. Being from the states I don't know if they have occupancy codes in Alberta but if there is I'm sure there are too many beds per square foot. At least in my room.\nOtherwise, the bathrooms were as clean as could be as were the common areas. The kitchen wasn't as tidy as my kitchen at home but then I don't have 100 people running through it at all hours.  \nI also do not think the owner's response to any form of criticism is professional or warranted, so that is a con. Due to that alone I won't return because I'd hate to have something come up on property and encounter this person. In fact, I'd have given a much high rating but based on his responses.. NO. \n\nThat's it.. a fairly fair review.  You'll probably enjoy the place and it will be a good option for you.",3,negative,"December 20, 2013",811 7 St SW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2P 1Z5

Take what these people write literally with less than a grain of salt. These people are serial whiners and not TRUE backpackers. \n\nWhere to start with Wicked... This has to definitely be the second best hostel I have stayed at in North America (first in Montreal). The value for money at this place far exceeds any other hostel I have stayed in. The fact the staff do all your washing for free is just unheard of and gratefully appreciated. Yep, even your dirty undies! ;) \nThat staff at Wicked make this place what it is and never fail to uphold it's stellar reputation. \nJeff, the owner of wicked and his Dad are two of the most genuine and hilarious people you will meet. They really try and keep this hostel what it should be - a fun, lively & true backpacking style environment. I booked for a week and ended up staying 3 weeks, and even then did not want to leave. Strangers became friends and friends quickly became like a little family. Everyone looks out for one another and respectful of everyone's possessions and space. \n** I did notice people complaining of no lockers in the rooms. I must admit not once did I feel like my personal belongings were unsafe or at risk of theft. I often left my phone, wallet, passport etc; on my bed, floor, kitchen table, bathroom without a worry in the world. Some may find that na\u00EFve, I believe it just proof of the type of environment Jeff has created and the type of people this place attracts. \nI also read a lot of comments on here about the hostel being \""cliquey\"" or hostile... I must admit that my first few days I sat on the couch with my ipad and headphones in and found it really hard to chat to people... I wondered what everyone else's problem was.. Then a lightbulb went off and I realized it wasn't the other people that had the problem, IT WAS ME! I was choosing to isolate myself with my music and head buried in my ipad. I was being ANTI SOCIAL and the other people at the hostel were showing me the respect of space and privacy it looked like I wanted. Once I realized that striking up conversations with people is that way to make friends, everything improved 100000% from there. By the end of my stay I knew I had made friends for life all over the world who I will go out of my way to travel and see in the future.\n\nJust to comment on a few smaller things - breakfast is amazing (even though I only made it to 3 breakfasts in the whole 3 weeks I was there due to being hungover, oops!) and provides everything you need to kick start your day. Location cannot be beat. Right on 17th Ave (close to hundreds of bars, restaurants, 2 casinos, liquor\u002Fgroceries) and across the rode from the Saddledome (Calgary Flames play there) and also the C-Train station to get you anywhere you need to go in Calgary. Downtown is a short 10 minute walk. \n\nSpecial mention to Dan, Mike, Paula & Lucas who work extremely hard and make your stay at Wicked always a positive one. I will definitely be back to stay here... Never thought I could miss staying in a hostel but I definitely will always have a soft spot for this place and plenty of memories & friendships that I will take with me on my travels. \nIt's the little things that count at this hostel, not just the big stuff. \n** if you read the website it clearly states this is a party hostel and full of backpackers all looking to have a good time and be social. Yes, we laugh - sometimes loudly. Yes, we play music until midnight. Yes, we drink in the common room mid-week. WE ARE BACKPACKERS and we are here to have a good time. Don't stay here if you want a 12 hour sleep. It's not a cheaper alternative to a hotel room... if you want quiet and boring book in at one of the many hotels around here... If you're outgoing, fun, social and looking to meet an amazing bunch of people, experience an awesome stay and make some life long friends, Wicked Hostels is perfect for you.",5,positive,"February 10, 2014",811 7 St SW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2P 1Z5

Very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe initial tour of the hostel is a brilliant idea, something that no other hostels do that I've stayed at! \n\nThe breakfasts are awesome here! Consisted of fruit pancakes!, toast, cereal, many spreads and free tea and coffee (massive bonus)\n\nCons:\nMonotonous music that's played all day, too loud and too late (until 12pm)! Just lower the volume a tad, stop music at 11pm and mix up the tracks, it really drives you crazy especially if your room is next to the common area - we weren't the only ones there who thought this. \n\nThe worst thing about our stay was the lack of sleep. I understand that it's the weekend and we like to party and have a good time but the music was played until 3:30am!! And people where loudly talking until 5am!  Its a joke and isn't fair on the majority of the people for whom I know we're affected. You really shouldn't have to stay up till 5am to have a good time. \n\nIf you have a 12pm noise rule, enforce it or just don't have it at all! The lack of sleep left us in a fowl mood about the whole place. The room walls are thin and thus the 'noise rule' should accommodate for this. \n\nThankfully the next few nights were fine, slept well. But it's those one offs that drags these ratings down for you. \n\nAs I said, it was a mixed bag as this hostel has some great aspects!

I stayed in this hotel a few years ago and it seems like everything is degraded due to lack of maintenance and upkeep. The hotel is advertised as a 3 star but is now run down to be a single star, \n\nAs we checked in, our room had bed sheet smell like vomit. The closet door was broken. Coffee machine not working. After being on the road for 10 hours we needed resting not worrying about getting things fixed and getting them in working order. We left from home at 5 AM to be able to enjoy the evening at an attraction in the city but instead spent time waiting for the staff to get at least the bed issue resolved. The evening was wasted along with all our efforts. At last we decided to go have dinner and the front desk assured us that they will have everything in order before our return. We returned at 9.30 PM, and nothing was done. I requested room change at that time and they didn't have any room ready and no house keeping staff at that time. At 11.00 PM they finally sent the restaurant staff to replace the bed sheet. He wasn't trained to do housekeeping and forgot comforter. It took two calls and 20 minutes to get it. By this time it was 11.30 PM, an already long day and we wanted to leave early the next morning. \n\nOfcourse the next morning we didn't have the luxury to get a cup of coffee before leaving the room. Since they hadn't fixed\u002Freplaced, our coffee machine was still broken. We mentioned this to the front desk as we left the hotel and requested to get the coffee machine and closet door fixed. No offer to get the coffee to go from their restaurant. \n\nWhen we returned at 9 PM, issues were unresolved and somehow the housekeeping had broken the bathroom sink. How did we know? Because the sink was filled with water and drain was blocked and not working. They didn't have a repair person at that time and no other room for us to move. And we were so tired to deal with it. We used the shower when needed to use sink. \n\nThis morning I called again and I was told they will have the repair person coming at 9 AM. At which time I asked to speak to the manager and was told there is no manager available until after our stay is over due to the long weekend. So, we are stuck here  with no functional sink and coffee machine \n(can live with the broken closet door). \n\nI wish I had gone to another hotel (I still might).",1,negative,"June 30, 2019",1250 McKinnon Drive N.E.,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2E 7T7

The living area was equipped with a bar type counter with sink, fridge and microwave oven, a fireplace and a second large flat screen TV.

We were told that they would empty garbage cans for us and if we had any garbage we could put it outside our room an they would pick it up.  We did wonder when we got back to the hotel why there were bags of garbage out side people's rooms.

So, she kept texting there for another 5 minutes only to tell me that my room was cancelled because their system broke down at the time. She said it sarcastically, without apology, without even explaining it thoroughly. I told her that I made a reservation almost 2 months ago, and showed her my confirmed email, she just shook her head and when I asked her why they didn\u2019t call me, she frowned at me and said \u201CWe don\u2019t do that.

My husband kept calling and googling hotels to stay in and it is all fully booked since it was a long weekend. If there are available hotels, the prices are tripled and really far from South Calgary where we planned to stay.

I called the hotel the morning of checkin day to ensure my reservation was good with 2 beds and to advise I would not be checking in until 10pm, and please do not give my room away.  When I checked in of course my worst fears came true.  I was told Idid not have a room with 2 beds and that I would have to take a room with 1 bed.  I explained my story and advised that this was not satisfactory to my situation.  The night clerk (dark haired man, I do not know his name) was very rude and unapologetic for the situation, frankly he did not really care.  After further discussion he went away and came back with a room with 2 beds (not real sure why one was suddenly available).  I expressed my disappointment about how we were being spoken to and treated and accepted the room.\n\nWhen I went to the room with my guest we could not get in.  The card lock on the door appeared to not be working (battery not working).  I went back to the desk and explained and I got an oh well I can\u2019t do anything about it, but I will let you in the room tonight.  I was told I would have to get someone each time one of us needed to get into the room until he could have someone look at it.  When I got into the room my disappointment continued.  There was:\nNo hangers\nNo sofa where a large space appeared it should have accommodated one\nNo ironing board\nThe microwave did not work\nThe lamp plugin beside the bed did not work to charge my phone, so it was still dead in the morning\nThe top plug in the bathroom did not hold a plug for my curling iron it would just fall out\nThere was no do not disturb sign (which was important because I did not want maintenance to wake us up early if they came to fix the door).  The night manager did come back with one but was cold and just appeared pissed off that he to find one and bring it to us\n\nCome morning we had to ask to be let into our room a couple of times until maintenance could be arranged, a real inconvenience to wait to have someone come and open the door.  The day manager then asked to pack our luggage and leave it with them for the day and they would move me into a new room for the second night.  I did this when I left in the morning.  When we got back at 5:30pm it took the front desk a few minutes but they found the new room for us (not the room we were told we were going into in the morning so not sure what happened).  The luggage was not in the room as promised so we took it up ourselves.  When we got to the new room it was much better, but still had a very frustrating thing about it.  When you turned the bathroom light on the fan turned on with it (very loud) so you had no way to go to the bathroom quietly at night with the light on unless you wanted the loud fan to run.  It was clearly a short cut fix at some point because the other switch for the fan did not work.  I was too tired to even look any further for issues as I was so frustrated.\n\nThere were also things in general about the hotel.  It was very run down and I questioned some of the cleaning, the black chairs in the front lobby were in desperate need of recovering, they looked like they had been pickup in a back alley.  The breakfast was not hot, only luke warm and the pancake machine did not work.

The hotel\u2019s motto is (written on a plaque in the room), \u201CMaking your stay a complete success is our goal. Just let our Manager on Duty or front desk staff know if any part of your stay isn\u2019t satisfactory. We promise to make it right or you won\u2019t pay for that part of your stay.\u201D That was completely untrue in my case. Here\u2019s my story:\nI booked a room through my business, in the \u201Cstandard\u201D room category. Upon checking in, a room with two beds was not available so I was given a King bed room (for four people). I didn\u2019t cancel because I didn\u2019t want to incur the late cancellation charge (but I should have!). I wanted to try to think with the front desk staff how we could make it work in the King room, and I asked for two cots. I was first told that two cots wouldn\u2019t fit. After an hour, one cot was brought up. I was then told that they didn\u2019t have sheets\u002Fblankets for the second cot (in a large hotel with many guests). The second cot didn\u2019t come, and I was then told that they didn\u2019t have another cot in the hotel. (This was during a half hour long conversation on the phone with the front desk, which involved the staff member remarking that it would be \u201CPerfect\u201D if we never stayed at the hotel again). We then asked for a duvet for the fourth person to sleep on the floor and were told that we could possibly pick it up at the front desk as they were super busy. A quick peak at the personnel at the front desk revealed a single customer in line with two staff members working, with one continuously on their personal phone. We finally went to the front desk to retrieve the duvet. (I\u2019ve excluded a lot here for brevity, but the majority of our night was trying to troubleshoot this issue).\nAfter a not-so-great sleep, on our way to breakfast at 8 am, one of the storage rooms was wide open. I peaked inside and saw at least three to four cots. I asked for one of those to be brought up for our second night. When I confronted the same staff members about the cots in the storage room, I was told they had never been in that room before.\nA secret cot storing room!\nI think not, just bad, misleading customer service. There was never a manager on duty either to talk to. (The second cot did finally arrive for the second night, and by the way, it fits just fine).\nFor a mid-grade hotel, the room we had was pretty rough (holes in the wall, loud AC fans, very small tv, roof bubbling and peeling\u2026)\nThis was not worth the headache. I would never stay here again. I think it\u2019s funny that the front desk staff actually thought their lazy excuses were smart enough to satisfy their customers.\nTL;DR - run away. Not worth the headache if you ever need to deal with staff, and not a quality hotel on the whole.",1,negative,"July 24, 2023",12025 Lake Fraser Drive,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2J 7G5

An amazing complimentary breakfast buffet with hot and cold items that were plentiful and constantly replenished.

The configuration is actually kind of fun with all of the bridges across from one side to the other. \n\nThe good:  The Staff, the staff, the staff!! They totally make this place. Their kindness, willingness to please is outstanding and not what I typically find in the US.  From front desk, to banquets (I was there teaching a class), to restaurant personnel, and the housecleaners; they all went above and beyond. I would come back just for that. \n\nThe room was clean and was relatively large for a king room (5th floor).  There was sitting area with a couch as well as the typical desk, bed and bath.  The room had a Keurig coffee maker (I believe that's only for the 5th floor rooms?), microwave and fridge which is important to me when I travel for business.  The bathroom wasn't roomy, but for one person it was more than adequate and everything was clean.  Note that they had really good hairdryers; not your typical mini-dryer that doesn't work well.  In room safe and ability to cast your phone to the tv if you want.  \n\nOur meeting room (front room as you walk into the hotel) had a weird configuration and we had a chore fitting our 42 students in it, but it worked well and banquet\u002F conference staff were more than supportive.    I visited the hotel gym which was large and airy.  Also impressive, their weight set was complete with 8lbs, which almost never happens when I travel (why is that?!).  \n\nThe breakfast buffet! What a surprise!  This was probably the best included breakfast buffet I've ever experienced. The scrambled eggs.. they were real!  So was the sausage!  I stepped into the elevator at one point with my tray and there was someone else who rode up with me, also with a tray. She took a bite of her bacon and so did I.. we looked at each other and said at the same time.. \""it's the real thing!\"".   The breads, bagels, cereal etc were also very good as well. \n\nThe not so great:  The bed was a little lumpy and the springs were loud. I still woke up without back pain, which is always the tell-tale sign for me for a good vs bad bed.  \n\nThe heat\u002Fair would probably be my biggest issue:  it was loud in the room and constantly woke me. I couldn't find a way to bring the heat down (setting it lower at night) without the a\u002Fc starting up rather than just having a heat\u002Foff setting.  Calgary in March; definitely don't need the a\u002Fc on!  But trying to get it down to 65 or so for sleeping was difficult.   As well, our meeting room temperature had wide fluctuations  and we had to ask staff to come in often to set it up or down.  \n\nThe elevator was super sloooow.  Once, I knew that, I would take the stairs, which is better for me when I'm traveling anyways. \n\nAll in all, a great stay.  I'll definitely ask my company to be  here again! \n\n   \n\n",4,positive,"March 16, 2023",1804 Crowchild Trl NW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2M 3Y7

We have the receipt that he sent that states it was paid in cash. Yet he charged my CC for the parking.  My friends CC does not show a fee from the hotel because she did NOT pay with a card but DID pay with cash.  In order for them to return the fee to my CC it has taken a lot of time and effort.  Both the supervisor and the manager (so I was told) are not customer service savvy.  \n in trying to sort this out.  Bottom line....the supervisor is up to some dirty fraudulent business.  Do NOT pay cash!!!  I say this because I know of two women who have been charged from 2 hotels for theft.  The customers who paid cash, they pocketed the cash.  Seems this is what happened to us.  First night that I paid with through a site, an employee female attempted to charge me again.  The last day the supervisor handed me someone else's invoice.

(I am terrible allergic to grapefruit and glad I read the label.)  I did mention this to the Front Desk. \n\nLots of confusion around billing for 14 nights parking.  Had to seek clarification on check out but also follow up in a few emails after that .  Website says if you stay , parking is free and if you add on long stay parking, well of course you pay differently for that.  We thought that meant we got our first and last night parking free and would pay the 14 days in between on the weekly long rate.  Not so.  Billed for those 2 nights extra.  Front desk people gave different weekly rates to us upon checking in and checking out.  $44 per week when we arrived  then told $69 per week plus tax when we were leaving. \n For parking outside in the lot.  Needed clarification big time.  Additionally when checking out hotel wanted to include 19 nights parking!  What ???  Straightened that out quick.

She called a yellow cab (next in line) and even checked this out with her Supervisor on radio to ensure the cab driver that this was okay.  Got to the hotel and this was a big problem.  Poor cab driver, standing around, going back and forth to his car for details, forms, etc.  Big hassle but he maintained his cool.

I thought I had booked a room in the Tower building, but I could have been mistaken. I was given a king bed room in the Atrium building. It is a little bit of a hike to get from the Tower building to the Atrium building if you want to stay indoors (elevator to the 3rd floor, take the Sky Bridge, then, for me, take the elevator to the second floor of the Atrium Building). \n\nMy room had a large desk area with plenty of outlets. The bathroom was a good size with lots of counter space. I liked the shelf system in the bathroom. I appreciated the mini-fridge in the room as I always like to keep cold drinks available. The closet space was limited since there were two beautiful robes taking up space along with the ironing board. There was a in room safe, which was a nice perk for a two night stay. The room was very clean and the bed was comfy. \n\nAlthough I had a car, I ended up eating 3 meals at the hotel because it was just so darn convenient. The adjacent taproom (Southland Yard Diner) had some nice local brews on tap. I got the French dip the first night and the blackbean burger with salad the second night.  I also ate lunch at Sage (off the lobby) one day. The chicken club was tasty and big enough for two to share. The menus between the two restaurants are virtually the same.\n\nThe Delta has two fitness facilities. The one in the Tower building is on the second floor right next to the elevators. This facility is open 24\u002F7 and is located above the pool with the water slide. There was an elliptical, bike, and several treadmills, along with free weights and a universal type weight machine. There was also a fridge with cool towels and a bowl of fresh fruit. The elliptical and bike both worked great. The other facility is on the 3rd floor of the Atrium and opens at 6:00 a.m. This facility had 2 ellipitcals and a bigger universal type weight machine. There were also free weights and other cardio equipment. The pool in the Atrium is beautiful and includes a large jacuzzi in the middle. \n\nAlthough you have to check in at the Tower Building, you can check out at the Atrium (if that is the building you are staying in). \n\nOn the Marriott website, this hotel is listed as a Category 2, so I wasn't expecting much.

I was given the breakfast vouchers, and given a rundown of the hotel.  \n\nOur initial room was an king suite in the atrium building.  The building was empty, like eery.  The rooms all overlook a central atrium, which houses a pool, hot tub and seating area. The pool and hot tub were filled, but there was a sign saying it was closed, which was a huge bummer as we were really hoping to use the facilities there, to avoid having to use the tower pool which has a water slide and isn\u2019t as quiet.  \n\nThe room was pretty big, and well kept, but the decor and hardware are dated. There was also a very musky distinct smoke smell, from previous tenants I\u2019m assuming.   We left our bags and went for dinner, and I chatted with Precious over the app.  She immediately set out to make it right and offered to move us into a different room and move our bags for us while we were gone. Great service!  \n\nWe returned to find we were upgraded to the jacuzzi suite.  The suite was quite large, with a seating area \u002F small table, and a separate bedroom.  Attached to the bedroom was a massive bathroom, possibly the largest hotel bathroom I\u2019ve seen, with jacuzzi tub, stand-alone shower, and vanity.  \n\nAll in all I enjoyed my stay here and will stay again if I\u2019m on the south side.

There was also nothing stating that in the rooms, however there was a print media that said if we want fresh linens to put them on the floor. \n\nSecond: there was hair on our bathroom floor and in the clean towels. There was spilled liquor in our mini fridge. There was bloody snot on the front of the bathroom door and something else as well. \n\nThird: our jacuzzi tub was broken. The control panel wasn\u2019t working well and was displaying EO1 and when the jets turned on it sounded  like there was a fighter jet engine in our room.\n\nForth: The TV picture was incredibly blurry. \n\nFifth: when the staff guy B  was informed by me that the jacuzzi tub was not functioning properly he told me I was wrong and that is how jacuzzis operate. Then when my spouse told the same staff (guy B) he informed my spouse that he would have Maintenance check the tub while we were out. We also informed guy Bof the housekeeping issues and were told it would be taken care of while we were out as well. When we arrived back at the hotel 9hrs later nothing was done. I went back downstairs to the lobby and told the other front desk staff ( guy C) about all of our problems and he was genuinely sorry and wanted to solve the issue. He informed us that we were supposed to be told that due to COVID the staff don\u2019t enter the rooms and if we need something we just need to contact the front desk. He switched our room to the other jacuzzi room and apologized that that wasn\u2019t done sooner as the room was vacant and blocked off. \n\nSo we move to the other room and there are hairs in the tub. I cleaned it up.

My family 3 adults 2 toddlers and I checked in to this hotel last July 31,2022. We are not from Calgary but we have few friends here and I let them know that we are staying here. I invited them to come over because we have not seen each other for a very long time. Three of my friends came in with their husbands and kids (three toddlers in total). We decided to use the indoor pool so the kids could have fun. But, what expected to be an enjoyable stay turned out to be a nightmare. I could not sleep last night thinking of the traumatic experience I and my friends had. We only spent an hour at the pool and decided to leave as soon as the people are coming in to enjoy this amenity. Then my friends waited outside my room while I am getting ready so we could head out for dinner. While I was struggling to get my toddler back to the room and all my friends are there on the hallway by the elevator, he suddenly came to us in a very arrogant way and in an angry tone asking if my friends are checked in or are coming as guests. I told him that they are my hotel guests. He continued to say in a loud voice that we should not use the pool if we are not hotel guests, and that we are very disrespectful. He further commented that he felt very disrespected that 15-20 non-paying guests used the pool and the towels and none left for other guests and he has to restock. He insisted that we used all the towels there. We only used four towels in total and in fact, there were not enough stocks of towels when we came in. A few guests have been there too and used the towels. He kept on saying I invited 15-20 people in the hotel. I have a video to prove how many people really used the swimming pool. He embarrassed me to tears in front of my friends and other guests passing by. He reprimanded me like I am a toddler. Where in fact, he could have approach me privately and inform me of what should have been done. The tone of his voice and the words that he stated felt humiliating and extremely rude. I felt that I was belittled and my friends were left speechless because they were shocked of the treatment we received. I was very calm and apologetic for I know that I also have a mistake of not asking permission before using the pool (which I think would be okay). I don\u2019t think I and any guest deserve to be treated like that. As a paying costumer, I don\u2019t deserve to be harassed verbally and emotionally. I am willing to pay for the pool usage and I am sorry I did not know the policy. Furthermore, what was really insulting was when he even told me that he will tell the breakfast buffet tomorrow to watch out for those 15-20 people as I may have a plan to invite my friends again for breakfast.\nI am hoping that there will be a resolution regarding this complaint and this situation will not be experienced again by any of your guest.\nI felt very stressed after what he said to the point that at night and next day I feel like I am going to have a miscarriage. I am emotionally harassed and I physically suffered.

I've stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world and my caveat here is that I know what I like and what I do not and that is reflected in this review.\n\nFirst, I don't like to pay rack rate for a room when better offers are available and on that aspect, Hotel Blackfoot scores 5*. It is consistently available on the offer sites like Hotels.com and the Hotel Tonight app at great prices so overall, the value is excellent.\n\nThe hotel has clearly had a lot of money spent on renovations and it has the air of a modern facility in most aspects. We didn't use services like the pool or fitness centre but we did visit the attached sports bar and the food was good. The soundproofing is excellent and the adjacent highway was not an issue at all.\n\nThe room we stayed in was reasonably spacious, well-equipped and clean with a nice bathroom. So far, so good...\n\nMy two big-ticket items after so many stays in hotels are 1) a large. comfortable (subjective) bed and 2) quiet air conditioning. The only thing that gives away the fact that this is an old hotel that has been refurbished is the old, noisy air conditioning unit. I turned mine off and chose to live with the higher temperature but I could still hear the unit in the rooms next door. I fail to see the point in having great external soundproofing when the loudest noise in inside the room. I mean, it isn't making a terrible noise but the hum and fan is much louder than on modern units. I did say that I know what I like, right? ;-)\n\nIn such a spacious room, the queen bed almost looks lost and there is plenty of room to fit king beds in there so it can only be a cost consideration that they are not present. In addition, the bed is squeezed up against a wall with maybe 50cm gap an a side table on only one side, again for no apparent reason. The bed does not line up with the TV on the wall when it would be easy to do that. These are the small things that turn 'good' into 'great'.\n\nI wasn't unhappy with my stay and it did offer great value for money. If you need a hotel in this vicinity, I would highly recommend the Blackfoot (and a visit to the excellent Prairie Dog Brewing Company close by) but if location is not critical, there are better option in the price range such as the excellent Westin Calgary Airport which has become my go-to location.",4,positive,"July 29, 2019",5940 Blackfoot Trail SE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2H 2B5

The complaint I have is with the housekeeping department. Check-out is at Noon however, I was visited by the housekeeper at 9:15 am using their key to open the room and ask when we were ;leaving. I told her by 12. Another knock came at 10:00 am while my husband was in the shower. A third time at 11:15 and she was surprised we were still there. I mentioned this at the desk that we felt rushed to leave when we reluctantly checked out at 11:30 just to get rid of the needy housekeeper. It made our experience with staying on the executive floors NOT enjoyable what-so-ever. They need some client experience training. I left this on a survey card that was left in the room and turned it in at check-out but no one from the hotel has ever reached out.

It's easy to access, has plenty of parking, is close to restaurants and clubs, and the location saves you from the hassle of driving downtown and finding a parking spot among the one-way streets.\n\nIt's only about 12 minutes away from downtown, with a simple route and a convenient entrance.\n\nThe Carriage House is flourishing under the skilled leadership of Food and Beverage Manager, Cam Pinkney, who brings his extensive sommelier knowledge and passion for hospitality to every aspect of your guest experience. \""Hospitality is how you make people feel\"" is a mantra that Cam lives and breathes and embodies in everything he does. And when you stay at the Carriage House, you will also enjoy Cam's enthusiasm and energy to make sure you have the best guest experience possible.\n\nI had a room with one queen bed - and I'm so glad I picked that option instead of two queen beds.

The room was booked for one night (Dec, 17) on Dec. 10\u002F23. It was a bitterly cold night in S. Alta. and when the \""guest\"" arrived , they realized that they had left their Visa card at home and therefore did not have the card with them to check in with.  But the guest was met by 2 NASTY front desk receptionists. To identify these 2 nasty people, they were both of Asian decent, speaking in poor broken English. After  trying to deal with them, so the guest could check in after a very cold over 2 hour drive from the South, they WOULD NOT allow the now X-guest a room or even suggest what to do. Not even a cot perhaps in the hallway. They would not  call the woman, who the customer had booked with over the phone a week before. The customer spent perhaps 3 to 4 hours trying to deal with these 2 horrible employees. Also it is noted that another woman who controlled the gateway to the \""crappy food\"" restaurant  and was supposedly the \""supervisor\"" would not or refused to call the lady who the room was booked with. That particular night there was a dog show going on somewhere that weekend in the city and there were a number of people checking in with their dogs. The dogs received better treatment than this paying customer and the gate keeper to the restaurant dismissed this now in tears customer looking around the person and smiling and trying to talk to a dog(s) !! The  3 inhumane employees also knew that the customer needed gas and they were happy to see customer leave with a vehicle on nearly empty. What kind of hospitality people are these??!!  DO NOT stay at the carriage house inn on Macleod Tr. when there are several hotels\u002Fmotels on Macleod Trail, who would have showed compassion and arranged something for the customer to stay at their hotel\u002Fmotel. How cruel can a \""welcome\"" bunch be in a city that prides itself on hospitality ?! NEVER EVER AGAIN will this customer (who was a regular patron) ever even look at this building driving right on by to another suitable hotel WITH HOSPITALITY. Good bye and good riddance to this establishment. If Travis is still the customer representative to this place, DO NOT TAKE DOWN this review . Allow people to read the severity of this treatment of an innocent former patron. ( It is noted that both the Lethbridge Travel Center and this person who booked the room , have read many poor reviews of carriage h. , especially the dealings of women serving in the restaurant. )  You are FAR FROM a hospitality center anywhere in the city of Calgary or likely on the North American continent, as the X-patron phoned 2-3 different hotels who didn't recognize such an establishment with that name but also were shocked and saddened about this case ... and were apologetic for a hotel establishment they didn't even recognize by name !",1,negative,3 weeks ago,9030 Macleod Trail SE,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2H 0M4

We opted to just get ready in the bathroom and check in at 3. \nWhen we checked in- our rooms weren\u2019t ready. We had to haul all out things back out. We had two young babies with us and a lot of stuff. We put our things quickly in our truck and ran back to the wedding. When we were able to check in at 6:30 pm some of our bags were stolen. We lost the wedding gift, a wallet and an irreplaceable family heirloom. The hotel was not helpful at all. We were told a manager would contact us Monday. This happened Saturday. \nThen they tried to charge us more than the wedding prices and it took a lot to get them to honour that price. Sunday morning housekeeping started banging loudly on our doors at 8 am. They woke everyone including the babies. They wanted to know when we were checking out. We said 11. They came back at 8:30 and asked again. Then came back at 9:30, banged on the door and asked a third time. Same people. It was frustrating to be woken up once but 3 times was outrageous! Check out is 11!! Why are you at my door at 8 am? And why 3 times! \nI wouldn\u2019t ever stay again.

After a long drive in inclement weather, I arrived around 8pm, stressed and exhausted.  Since I required a room for one night only and would be leaving extremely early for work, I basically just needed a bed and a shower for the few hours I would be there, so I chose the least expensive hotel on the internet.  Not surprisingly, the site had shown NUMEROUS vacancies for this particular hotel at the time as it was also a weeknight.  I had already booked and paid for my room on-line, had an itinerary number, the credit card associated with the booking and directly linked to my TD Expedia account, and several other pieces of identification, including my Health Care work badge photo ID with my full name and title, provincial health card (government issued ID), temporary drivers's license as I had just updated mine etc. etc.  Since my photo was not on the temporary DL, this was not enough for this receptionist, who then insisted on viewing a passport.....all to spend a FEW HOURS at a TWO STAR HOTEL.  For obvious reasons, I do not routinely carry my Canadian passport with me while travelling in my vehicle within my own province.  Unfortunately, I did not realize that my DL would be taken from me that day for a simple address change.  I explained this ad nauseam to the rude, abrupt receptionist but to no avail.  I then asked to speak to a manager, and she FLATLY REFUSED to accommodate my request in any way, offering no means to contact her superiors at that time, nor in the future.  Her response was instead to attempt to lecture me about my \""attitude\""  which in turn, escalated the exchange to her threatening to call the police if I did not leave the property.  I left, then immediately returned, demanding to speak with management.  Her extremely shocking, irrational, absurd and outrageously exaggerated response, was to pick up the phone and repeatedly yell that she was calling the police, while screaming at me to \""leave the property\"". This ignorant incapable young woman whose badge read only \""Marilyn\"", lacked the minimal basic discernment skills and deduction ability required to establish that I was indeed, beyond any reasonable doubt, EXACTLY who I claimed to be.  Add questionable intelligence to a deluded and exaggerated sense of authority and self-importance, and this is what I was dealing with, merely a few hours before I needed to be at work, and now stranded at 9pm in MINUS 20C weather.\n\nI then called my booking agency to attempt to obtain a refund, and the agent kept me on hold for twenty minutes while he called the hotel, evidently, according to the agent, eighteen of those involved him listening to the same receptionist attempting to rationalize her behaviour and spew her grossly exaggerated version of the incident while I waited in my vehicle.  Other than that, the only thing the booking agent was able to accomplished from that conversation, was to establish that \""Marilyn\"" claimed she did not have the authority to refund my credit card, and that there was not a manager available for him to speak with at the time.\n\nI then had no other choice but to find another hotel, and fortunately the first hotel I inquired at, which was on the same block, contained pleasant well trained and highly professional staff who had NO PROBLEM accommodating me with the identification that I provided.  It was a little more expensive, but far nicer, with substantially more amenities and friendly staff who were capable of making minor decisions on their own, rather than blindly following direction without being trusted to use common sense or good judgement, but as the saying goes, \""You only get what you pay for\"".\n\nIncidentally, it does not state anywhere on the website nor booking agency site that you will be refused a room and refund, unless specific identification requirements are met upon arrival.  I have travelled all over this continent as well as several others, and have NEVER encountered such incompetence from an establishment. \n\nI am STILL in the process of attempting to have management issue a refund to my credit card, for a room that I was not permitted to use.

When I read the info about the hotel it said they had rooms off of the courtyard.  My experience of a room off of the courtyard is sliding doors onto a garden type area. That would be nice so I called the hotel to see if they would book us into one of those rooms. The attendant said no problem, she had us booked in one of those rooms. When we arrive we are given our room number and keys. Get to the room and no door to a courtyard however we are on the ground floor right off the parking lot.  So I go back to the desk and they tell me, that we are off the courtyard. The courtyard is the parking lot. First time I\u2019ve heard a parking lot called a courtyard.  Was not pleased about that. We were there for 3 days so was expecting to relax a bit in the courtyard. The room was nothing fancy but  it was clean.  The beds were comfortable.  On a down note the freezer in the fridge was totally frozen over. For the most part the room was acceptable.  The breakfast was fairly good and the attendant kept bringing out more food as needed. A note to the hotel. I suggest to keep your costs down you should eliminate people hauling out food by the plates full. We witnessed several people eating their fill while in the breakfast room and then taking a heaping plate full of food with them. One man even came back and took a second plate of food. Now for the reason I gave it a lower rating is because of the parking. Or should I say the absence of parking. When the hotel is full there is not enough parking. People were parking all along the driveway. Even in front of the lobby. There isn\u2019t even street parking or another lot you could go into.  We had to go out and returned to find that there was NO where to park except right at the entrance to the hotel which was a curved entrance and one handicap parking place. The desk attendant told me to park on the curved entryway. I said no way. If someone would be pulling into the hotel I likely would get rear ended. I suggested the handicap spot so he kindly said that he would tell security not to tow my vehicle. That was the first night.

With cost a major factor, in spite of a lot of negative reviews, we booked a three-night stay at the Econolodge Motel Village.\n\nIt turned out to be a pleasant stay, and the place suited our needs perfectly.  Guests should realize this is an Econolodge.  It's not a full service hotel, and it is an older property.  There are certainly nicer hotels in the Motel Village area, but they cost quite a bit more.  The Econolodge has been decently maintained, and our room was clean and had comfortable beds.  There was adequate storage, the shower had good water pressure, and lighting in the room was surprisingly bright.  Amenities include cable TV and free wi-fi internet access.  The hotel staff were very pleasant.  We dealt with three different front desk employees and a variety of housekeeping workers.  Without exception they were polite, friendly, and helpful.\n\nWe did not have any of the negative experiences other reviewers have mentioned.  Some writers here complained about noise, but there was nothing unusual at all during our stay. We certainly had no problems sleeping. Others suggested the area was unsafe.  Motel Village is certainly not a beautiful neighborhood, but it didn't appear crime-ridden.  The area is well lit, and local people were out walking well into the evening.  There were also people who complained that there was nowhere to park.  The hotel seemed to be full when we were there, but there were always at least a few spaces in the lot.\n\nI'd agree with those who noticed a strong odor of air freshener in the lobby.  The smell was pronounced, but it wasn't anything unpleasant.  There's essentially no view at all out the windows (just the parking lot and other hotels and restaurants), but that wasn't the reason we were there.  Our room was hot when we arrived, and the air conditioner struggled a bit to cool it down.  Once it did, though, it stayed cool through the rest of our stay.\n\nThe hotel's location really couldn't be better.  It's right off of the Trans-Canada Highway, buses stop right in front, and it's a short walk to the Banff Trail station, from which the C-Train will whisk you downtown in just a few minutes and whisk you all over the city quite easily.  (Hint:  It's shorter and easier to get to the station by leaving from the back of the hotel and walking past the Best Western and McMahon Stadium.)  We were pleased to park our car for three days and not have to deal with city traffic.  When we left, it was a very easy drive leaving town to the west.\n\nThere's a Denny's and a Boston Pizza (which has a huge menu that includes steaks, ribs, and salads) right next door to the hotel, and just a short walk away you'll find McDonalds, Dairy Queen, Phil's family restaurant, a steakhouse, and local Vietnamese and Indian restaurants.  One stop south on the C-Train (and not a long walk either) is a major shopping mall with a huge Sears department store, a Safeway supermarket, a nice food court, a 24-hour Shoppers Drug Mart, and a wonderful Purdy's candy store.\n\nMy only real complaint with this hotel would be the breakfast.  It is extremely minimal, not really even what I'd call \""continental\"".  Basically there's toast or muffins, plus weak coffee and watered-down juice.  That was surprising in an era when most hotels are expanding their breakfast offerings.  After the first day, we passed on the Econolodge breakfast and instead went to the McDonalds down the street.\n\nWhile I do find it odd that room prices are higher in Calgary than they are in Toronto or Chicago, we take the market for what it is.

There were only two pots in the kitchen - not enough to cook a meal for 6 people; nothing to put our salad in, no tea kettle, no tea pot.  After a \""make do\"" supper, (we couldn't cook the three things we'd brought) some of us thought we'd go use their advertised fitness centre, as we don't have passes to a fitness centre in our city.  Oops - the stationery bike wasn't working, neither was the weight machine.  Only the treadmill worked - which was fine for one out of six of us...!  OK, then we'll watch a good movie on the advertised \""free movie channel\"".  When we turned to Channel 150 as directed, we only got a grey screen.  It also seemed we were missing some bedding - when we mentioned it on the way back from our non-work-out, they said it would be there right away.  They were right - we got a phone call inviting us to walk through the snow storm to the main office and pick it up.  Maybe they had no staff that night.  The \""free starter breakfast\"" the next morning was truly that - one muffin wrapped in plastic and a juice box.  Its a good thing the diabetic brought her own food that day, just in case.  \n\nMaybe this is normal for a hotel - we don't have a lot of experience.  We just thought for a special Family Day treat this year, it might be a little more of a \""treat\"".\n\nThe worst part of it though was when we found a (to us) large amount of money hidden behind a light fixture in the suite.  We wrestled with our consiences and finally decided to report that we'd found something valuable and turn it in to the rightful owner.  We were afraid to hand in cash, because everyone would have the same trouble being honest about it.  We told the person at the check-out desk that if someone called about missing cash, they should be directed to us - we could ask them how much money and where it was stashed, and return it to them if they identified it correctly.  However, we were told to hand it in and they would donate it to a charity if no one asked about it.   If I turn something in to the police, I get it back after a certain time.  If I turn it in to the Econolodge Hotel, I don't - I don't even get to choose where it gets donated.  The whole stay left a bad taste in my mouth.  \n\nBe warned.\n",2,negative,"February 21, 2005",2440 16 Ave NW,"('Calgary',)",Alberta,T2M 0M5

(There's probably something to said for that whole \""getting what you pay for\"" thing, but we're not there yet. Spoilers.) \n\nThe staff we interacted with were all friendly, especially the man that checked us in. He was very, very thorough and pleasant. He even called up to our room to double-check all was well so far. It was very nice of him, but we'd pretty much just put our bags down, so it still all seemed fine. A couple minutes later, he called again to double-check if we had enough towels. We didn't, so he ran some up right away. Perfect start.\n\nThe pillows were probably my favourite part (besides the pleasant staff). They were seriously comfy. And the room was clean. I mean, we're not the shine-a-blacklight-to-find-the-bodily-fluids types, so who knows, but it seemed clean enough. Oh, and the discount at Denny's was rad (especially because the breakfast at the hotel was a rather sad affair).\n\nBecause we were there for a four-day event that would have us out and about for most of the day every day, we had some snacks with us that needed to be refrigerated, including both dairy and meat products. We open the fridge and wham. We were downright assaulted by a rather revolting smell. And it wasn't even particularly cold. We were all exhausted after a very full day, so we really didn't feel like dealing with it that night and decided we'd let the front desk know the next morning at breakfast. We did, and when we got back that evening, it seemed totally cool (pun intended, heh heh). Turns out, though, it was a lot more than cool. It froze everything we had and rendered the produce inedible. Being the smart, capable women we are, we just turned it down a nudge. Apparently the fridge didn't like that either and went back to being little more than room temperature. We no longer could trust this machine, nor could we trust the dairy and meat products we'd stored in it wouldn't find their way out of systems in less-than-pleasant ways, so more food waste. Not great.\n\nThe walls are paper-thin. Sure, our neighbours could have kept the talking to a more reasonable middle-of-the-night level, but I don't think I should have been able to feel like they were towering over me as they discussed the latest episode of the Bachelor for anything less than screaming. Also not great.\n\nThe shower was super weird. A big step up, but then a normal shallow tub. I don't get it. The shower head was also so low. I'm not short, but I'm not TALL, if you know what I mean, so I don't feel like being an extra from the Matrix should have been a pre-requisite to clean my flowing locks.\n\nA few other highlights (lowlights?) include the ridiculously uneven floor (nearly fell flat on my face tripping in a hole, and I was INDOORS, you guys), the slightly disconcerting tower of old microwaves down the hall (fire hazard, much?), and the patio door that opens juuuust far enough to squeeze out.\n\nNot much else to be said, really.

I don't know about all the primadonnas on here giving out bad reviews. It's a budget hotel folks, not the freakin' Hilton! And as a budget hotel they have a fine line between making a go of it or not, so yes, a damaged or stained towel or a light left on DOES make a difference!  I can only speak from my own experience, which was great!  Checked in April 11, 2018 into room 207 at $44\u002Fnight.  After reading all the bad reviews I wasn't expecting much but thought I would give it a try anyway. I was not disappointed. In fact, I enjoyed my stay so much I extended and booked a second night.  I am actually still at the hotel as I write this. Checking out in about 30 minutes. I can't fault the room at all. Perhaps there are differences with the rooms, but for sure the one I am in is perfectly clean, quiet, with a window that opens, in good shape, comfy bed, good sheets and pillows, writing\u002Fcomputer desk, small chest of drawers, flat screen TV, remote that works, clean bathroom, new toilet and tub and sink. Wall coverings in god shape and look new. Hardwood parquet flooring in hallways and room. (no musty carpets or carpet runners!). I spent the previous night at another well known large chain hotel just up the road and I can say that it was in fact, not as clean and certainly no better a hotel room, for more than twice the price. The hallway outside the room was slightly noisy when a big guy with hard soled shoes walked by, due to the fact it was hardwood flooring, but I will take a little bit of noise any day over a musty smelling carpet runner.  For the most part the clientele I saw here were decent, respectable neighbours.  The hotel staff I found to be polite, friendly and accommodating and helpful.  So to all you complainers...put a smile on your own face and you will get one back. Don't act like a dick, don't break the rules and don't trash your room, and you will probably be pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable your stay is.  The breakfast is on par with any Super-8 hotel. Eating area was a nice size, spotlessly clean, with windows that look outside onto MacLeod Trail and the adjacent property...not a small windowless dark room as was the previous hotel I stayed in.

She refused to allow us to do the check out with her then came back with a picture of burned tinfoil which we never used or physically seen, then she said we forefit our deposit as we used drugs. I immediately called the calgary police worried I would be in some sort of trouble but the police informed us they are there frequently for the same reason. They look for out of town plates and take cash or credit deposits and charge customers up on towels excetera. The police officer was kind and did what he could which was nothing but let us go on our way as he suspected no drug use. I showed him the pictures that we took and police officer said that this is what they do.
